If you're good at spotting viral posts before they blow up:

Create markets for promising posts
Let others trade on your insights
Earn fees from all transactions

#### How it Works for Curators

1. **Spot Potential**: Find a promising post early on and create a market for it
2. **Let Others Trade**: As the post gains traction, traders buy in
3. **Earn Curator Fees**: Get a 2% cut of all transaction volume in your market

### For Traders

If you want to profit from viral content:

Find promising markets early
Buy in before posts go viral
Sell when engagement peaks
Trade based on your insights

#### How it Works for Traders

1. **Find Markets**: Browse newly created markets for promising posts
2. **Trade**: Buy tokens when you think a post will go viral
3. **Profit**: Sell when the post gains significant engagement
